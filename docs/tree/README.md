# Tree Data Structure

- Trees are well-known as a non-linear data structure. 
- They donâ€™t store data in a linear way. 
- They organize data hierarchically.

## A techincal definitions

- A `Tree` is a collection of entities called `nodes`. 
- Nodes are connected by `edges`.
- Each node contains a `value` or `data`, and it may or may not have a child node .

#### Root node

- The `first node` of the tree is called the `root`. 
- If this `root node` is connected by another `node`, the `root` is then a `parent node` and the connected `node` is a `child`.

#### Edges

- All `Tree nodes` are connected by links called `edges`.
- It's an important part of `trees`, because it's managse the relationship between `nodes`.

#### Leaves

- `Leaves` are the last `nodes` on a `tree`. 
- They are nodes without children.

#### Height

- The `height` of a `tree` is the length of the longest path to a `leaf`.

#### Depth

- The `depth` of a `node` is the length of the path to its `root`.
