# Tree Traveral

We have two opions here:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** 

- **DFS** is an algorithm for travering or seraching tree data structure. One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- **BFS** is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure. It starts at the tree root and explores the neighbour nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.
