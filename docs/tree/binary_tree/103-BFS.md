# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**BFS** algorithm traverses the `tree` level by level and depth by depth.

Here is an example that helps to better explain this algrithm:

So we traverse level by level. In this example, this result is 1-2-5-3-4-6-7.

- Level/Depth 0: only `node` with value `
- Level/Depth 1: `nodes` with values 2 and 5.
- Level/Depth 2: `nodes` with values 3, 4, 6, and 7.

```python
def bfs(self):
    queue = Queue()
    queue.put(self)

    while not queue.empty():
        current_node = queue.get()
        print(current_node.value)

        if current_node.left_child:
            queue.put(current_node.left_child)

        if current_node.right_child:
            queue.put(current_node.right_child)
```

To implement a **BFS** algorithm, we use the `queue` data structure to help:

Let's understand with an explanation:

Steps:

1. First add the `root`, node into the `queue` with the `put` method.
2. Iterate while the `queue` is not empty.
3. Get the first `node` in the `queue`, and them print its value.
4. Add both `left` and `right` children into the `queue` (if the current node has `children`).
5. Done. We will print the valeu of each `node`, level by level, with our `queue` helper.
